        "\n",
        "Consider having a big box packed with vibrant blocks. A number is represented by each block. Let's imagine you want to arrange these blocks in creative patterns using a variety of shapes and sizes. Machine learning reshaping is similar to arranging these blocks to create new shapes without altering the numbers that are written on the blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "These are the main reasons why you should even consider reshaping:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Input compatibility:** Let's say you have a machine learning algorithm that takes in images of different fruits and tries to classify them. But the algorithm expects the images to have a specific size, like 64 pixels by 64 pixels. However, your fruit images are of various sizes. Reshaping allows you to resize these images, like stretching or squeezing, so that they all become the same size. This way, you can feed them into the algorithm without any issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data manipulation:** Imagine you have a long list of numbers in a single row, like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. But you want to analyze the numbers in a table format, with rows and columns. Reshaping helps you transform this list into a table-like structure, like [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]. Now you have rows and columns, and you can perform various calculations or operations more easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Model architecture:** Let's say you're building a model to recognize handwritten digits. To process the images effectively, you need to reshape the input data. Think of the images as jigsaw puzzles. Each puzzle piece represents a pixel, and the final image is made up of all these pieces. Reshaping here involves arranging the puzzle pieces in the right order and making sure they fit together properly. By reshaping the image into a 2D grid, you're allowing the model to analyze and understand the pixel patterns better.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Error handling:** Imagine you're using a pre-trained model that expects input images to have three color channels (red, green, and blue). However, the image you want to use has only one color channel (grayscale). Reshaping comes to the rescue! You can reshape the image to add the missing color channel dimension, making it compatible with the model's requirements. It's like putting on a pair of magical glasses that can see colors where there were none before!"

        "Imagine you have a playful bunch of inflatable toys, each representing a tensor. These toys come in different shapes and sizes, but they all have one thing in common: they can expand and contract like balloons. Now, squeezing in machine learning is a bit like manipulating these inflatable toys to make them smaller in certain dimensions, just like squeezing the air out of a balloon!\n",

        "In machine learning, squeezing refers to the process of removing dimensions with a size of 1 from a tensor. It's like compressing or squishing the tensor to make it more compact, without losing any valuable information. Squeezing is particularly useful when dealing with tensors that have unnecessary or redundant dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few scenarios where squeezing comes into play:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Dimension reduction:** Let's say you have a tensor that represents the probabilities of different classes for a classification task. If the tensor has a shape of (1, 10, 1), it means there's only one sample, ten classes, and one prediction per class. In this case, squeezing can be applied to remove the redundant dimensions, resulting in a tensor with shape (10). Now you have a simple 1D tensor representing the probabilities for each class, without unnecessary dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Model output:** Squeezing is often used to simplify the output of a model. For example, in natural language processing tasks, you may have a language model that generates sequences of words. The model may output sequences with shape (1, T, 1), where T is the length of the generated sequence. By squeezing the tensor along the first and third dimensions, you can obtain a more concise representation of the generated sequence with shape (T)."
